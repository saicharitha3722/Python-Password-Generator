1. ```python
   import random
   ```
   This line imports the `random` module, which is used to generate random numbers and make random choices.

2. ```python
   def generatePassword(pwlength):
   ```
   This line defines a function named `generatePassword` which takes a list `pwlength` as input. This list contains the lengths of the passwords to be generated.

3. ```python
   alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
   ```
   This line initializes a string `alphabet` containing all lowercase letters of the English alphabet. This string will be used to generate random passwords.

4. ```python
   passwords = []
   ```
   This line initializes an empty list `passwords` to store the generated passwords.

5. ```python
   for i in pwlength:
   ```
   This line starts a loop iterating over each element `i` in the list `pwlength`, which contains the desired lengths of the passwords to be generated.

6. ```python
   password = ""
   ```
   This line initializes an empty string `password` to store the characters of the current password being generated.

7. ```python
   for j in range(i):
   ```
   This line starts a nested loop iterating `j` times, where `j` goes from 0 to `i-1`. This loop is responsible for generating the characters of the password based on its length (`i`).

8. ```python
   next_letter_index = random.randrange(len(alphabet))
   password = password + alphabet[next_letter_index]
   ```
   These lines generate a random index within the range of the length of the `alphabet` string and use it to select a random letter from the alphabet. This letter is then appended to the `password` string.

9. ```python
   password = replaceWithNumber(password)
   password = replaceWithUppercaseLetter(password)
   ```
   These lines call two functions (`replaceWithNumber` and `replaceWithUppercaseLetter`) to replace some characters of the generated password with numbers and uppercase letters, respectively.

10. ```python
    passwords.append(password)
    ```
    This line appends the generated password to the `passwords` list.

11. ```python
    return passwords
    ```
    This line returns the list `passwords` containing all the generated passwords.

12. ```python
    def replaceWithNumber(pword):
    ```
    This line defines a function named `replaceWithNumber`, which takes a string `pword` as input and replaces some of its characters with random numbers.

13. ```python
    for i in range(random.randrange(1, 3)):
    ```
    This line starts a loop that iterates a random number of times between 1 and 2.

14. ```python
    replace_index = random.randrange(len(pword)//2)
    ```
    This line generates a random index within the first half of the length of the `pword` string, indicating where the replacement with a number will occur.

15. ```python
    pword = pword[0:replace_index] + str(random.randrange(10)) + pword[replace_index+1:]
    ```
    This line replaces the character at the `replace_index` position of the `pword` string with a randomly generated digit (from 0 to 9).

16. ```python
    return pword
    ```
    This line returns the modified `pword` string after replacing characters with numbers.

17. ```python
    def replaceWithUppercaseLetter(pword):
    ```
    This line defines a function named `replaceWithUppercaseLetter`, which takes a string `pword` as input and replaces some of its characters with random uppercase letters.

18. ```python
    for i in range(random.randrange(1, 3)):
    ```
    This line starts a loop that iterates a random number of times between 1 and 2.

19. ```python
    replace_index = random.randrange(len(pword)//2, len(pword))
    ```
    This line generates a random index within the second half of the length of the `pword` string, indicating where the replacement with an uppercase letter will occur.

20. ```python
    pword = pword[0:replace_index] + pword[replace_index].upper() + pword[replace_index+1:]
    ```
    This line replaces the character at the `replace_index` position of the `pword` string with its uppercase equivalent.

21. ```python
    return pword
    ```
    This line returns the modified `pword` string after replacing characters with uppercase letters.

22. ```python
    def main():
    ```
    This line defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.

23. ```python
    numPasswords = int(input("How many passwords do you want to generate? "))
    ```
    This line prompts the user to input the number of passwords they want to generate and converts the input into an integer.

24. ```python
    passwordLengths = []
    ```
    This line initializes an empty list `passwordLengths` to store the lengths of the passwords to be generated.

25. ```python
    for i in range(numPasswords):
    ```
    This line starts a loop iterating `numPasswords` times, where `i` represents the index of the current password being generated.

26. ```python
    length = int(input("Enter the length of Password #" + str(i+1) + " "))
    ```
    This line prompts the user to input the length of the current password and converts the input into an integer.

27. ```python
    if length < 3:
        length = 3
    ```
    This conditional statement ensures that the minimum length of the password is set to 3 if the user input is less than 3.

28. ```python
    passwordLengths.append(length)
    ```
    This line appends the length of the current password to the `passwordLengths` list.

29. ```python
    Password = generatePassword(passwordLengths)
    ```
    This line calls the `generatePassword` function with the list of password lengths as an argument and assigns the returned list of generated passwords to the variable `Password`.

30. ```python
    for i in range(numPasswords):
    ```
    This line starts a loop iterating `numPasswords` times to print each generated password.

31. ```python
    print("Password #" + str(i+1) + " = " + Password[i])
    ```
    This line prints the index of the current password along with the corresponding generated password.

32. ```python
    main()
    ```
    This line calls the `main` function, starting the execution of the program.
